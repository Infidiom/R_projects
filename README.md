# R_projects

## This project is based around the R programming language, and the documents are based on reading and extracting data from CSV files, these files have been taken from Kaggle

My first R file takes its data from the mtcars data set, 32 cars are compared based on 11 different attributes, I have successfully found the dimensions of the data set, a summary of an attribute within the data set that takes into account: minimum, maximum, median, mean 1st and 3rd quartile. These statistics are effective in compiling data to be analysed and forming accurate conclusions.
