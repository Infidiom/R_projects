# R_projects

## This project is based around the R programming language, and the documents are based on reading and extracting data from CSV files, these files have been taken from Kaggle

My first document takes data from ~700 students on social media and its effect on performance such as academic level, hours asleep and their mental health, the aim of the file is to compile data from these different factors and from this suggest a direct correlation between two or more factors.
